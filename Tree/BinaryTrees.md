- A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.
- It is also known as a proper binary tree.

`Theorems`
- The number of leaves is `i + 1`.
- The total number of nodes is `2i + 1`.
- The number of internal nodes is `(n – 1) / 2`.
- The number of leaves is `(n + 1) / 2`.
- The total number of nodes is `2l – 1`.
- The number of internal nodes is `l – 1`.
- The number of leaves is at most `2λ - 1`.
